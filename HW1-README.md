# Description 

For this project I added Semantic elemnts and organized the code logically. I also added alt attributes to all image elements. I fixed connection issuses between the css style sheet and the html document. I fixed html elemts to properly display images, text, header, ect... I also fixed menu links so that they take you to the page they are assigned to.
